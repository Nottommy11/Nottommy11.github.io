### Minimum Viable Product
<div name="minimum-viable-product"/>

This section outlines what this website has to at least accomplish to provide use to visitors.

Users are able to:
- [ ] Create accounts
- [ ] Add new tabs
- [ ] Add new todos
- [ ] Search their todos by keywords
- [ ] Navigate their tabs and only see selected todos
- [ ] Mark a todo as completed
- [ ] Delete a todo
- [ ] Select settings related to their todo
- [ ] Open a new tab of their todo
- [ ] Open all todos in a new window/group
- [ ] Have their information at least stored locally

### Hopes & Dreams
<div name="hopes-dreams"/>

This section outlines what I hope to get to with this project.

- [ ] Create a Chrome Extension to let users manage their todo list
- [ ] Get YouTube thumbnails via either an API or some other method
- [ ] Automatically get a thumbnail of a saved todo and allow the user to change that thumbnail
- [ ] Store data in a database

### Further Documentation
<div name="documentation"/>

This will include information about how I would like this project to look and perhaps some resources that helped me along the way.
