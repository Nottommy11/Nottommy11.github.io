### Minimum Viable Product
<div name="minimum-viable-product"/>

This section outlines what this website has to at least accomplish to provide use to visitors.

Users are able to:
- [ ] Create accounts
- [X] Add new tabs
- [X] Add new todos
- [ ] Search their todos by keywords
- [ ] Navigate their tabs and only see selected todos
- [X] Mark a todo as completed
- [X] Delete a todo
- [ ] Select settings related to their todo
- [ ] Open a new tab of their todo
- [ ] Open all todos in a new window/group
- [ ] Have their information at least stored locally
- [ ] Delete a the tab doesn't delete the todos associated with it. Still saved locally & possibly in a database instead
- [ ] Responsively display on mobile devices
- [ ] Upload an image for a todo

### Hopes & Dreams
<div name="hopes-dreams"/>

This section outlines what I hope to get to with this project.

- [ ] Create a Chrome Extension to let users manage their todo list
- [X] Get YouTube thumbnails via either an API or some other method
- [X] Get YouTube video title via Google(YouTubev3) API
- [ ] Automatically get a thumbnail of a saved todo and allow the user to change that thumbnail
- [ ] Store data in a database
- [ ] Load todos from bookmarks of chosen browser
- [ ] Display search results as two columns: Tabs and then Todos
- [ ] Filter search results based on link type
- [ ] Autofill the name from other websites besides YouTube
- [ ] Get a preview of the website from the link to display in the todo
- [ ] Make the website prettier
